# Mission-to-Mars

# Overview
This assignment explored creation of a Web Scraping application to pull data from a web page's HTML elements to display in it's own HTML and CSS-stylized format. The web pages that were scraped for data via HTML were marshemispheres.com (Mars Hemisphere Images), spacesimages-mars.com (Featured Mars Image), and redplanetscience.com (Article information and facts about Mars). Using the BeautifulSoup dependency, text and image URLs were extracted using find and find_all methods to look within HTML containers by tags and classes. Then, using the Bootstrap CSS infrastructure for our HTML template, the application created a locally-hosted web page that was responsive to the viewing device's screen resolution.
